# Self-Havoc-II
{Showcase - https://llxskywalkerxll.github.io/webhavoc.github.io/index.html}  
Self Havoc â€“ II is a 3D-based third person game (an extension of my game, Self Havoc-I [https://github.com/llxSKyWALKeRxll/Self_Havoc]) built by making use of Java and OpenGL. The game uses the various core concepts of object oriented programming in order to implement the 3D setting and the various features in the game, obviously with the support of the countless in-built functions and methods that are provided by OpenGL and LWJGL. There is a player model (no animation) in Self Havoc-II and it will be visible to the user at all times. The player can roam freely around the world and explore the beautiful world that has many realistic features such as fog, height-map terrain, different trees and textures, etc.  
Self Havoc-II consists of many features. It makes use of various shaders such as fragment shader, vertex shader, terrain shader, etc. to implement a plethora of features that add to the richness of the game and its environment. The game also has realistic fog that appears to blend in with the background and the sky depending upon the player's distance from a particular point. The game also has height-map terrain. It also has object-collision detection. The player model can be controlled by the input that can be provided by the user through the keyboard and the camera can be controlled through the mouse input. The camera can be zoomed in and out as well. The player model can jump and sprint too. Phong lighting (per-pixel lighting, specular lighting and diffuse lighting) has also been implemented in the game along with multi-texturing. Mip-mapping is also implemented in the game in order to optimize its performance.
